# Advent of Code

## 2022

I figured it would be nice to try and do AoC this year, my first time! I have
been working through [The Awk Programming Language](https://ia803404.us.archive.org/0/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf)
and this provides a perfect opportunity to try and practice my extremely new Awk
skills.
